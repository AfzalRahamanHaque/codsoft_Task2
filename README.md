# Movie Rating Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of Indian movies, such as year of release, votes, and duration, the model uncovers patterns that influence audience ratings.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDb Movies dataset, which includes several features related to movies, such as:
- Name
- Year
- Duration
- Genre
- Rating
- Votes
- Director
- Actor 1
- Actor 2
- Actor 3

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading:** Loaded the IMDb Movies dataset using Pandas and examined its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and converted data types for accurate analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created meaningful features, including:
   - Year of release
   - Votes count
   - Duration of the movie
   - Mean ratings based on Genre, Director, and Actors
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Ensured all features were numeric and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training:** Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict movie ratings based on the engineered features.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.
7. **Visualization:** Created insightful visualizations to understand relationships in the data and the model's predictions.
8. **Real-World Application:** Developed a framework for predicting movie ratings based on user input.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Preprocessing:** Gained experience in cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Learned the importance of creating relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Hands-on experience with training models and assessing their accuracy.
- **Visualization Skills:** Enhanced skills in data visualization to effectively communicate insights.
